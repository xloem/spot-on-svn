Spot-On is composed of two separate applications, a kernel and a
user interface. Both applications exist independently of one other.

<br><br>

The kernel is responsible for all system-level functions. It maintains
listener and neighbor activities, URL categorization, and URL searches.

<br><br>

The interface communicates with the kernel via SQLite databases. Therefore,
an advanced user may direct kernel activity from an SQLite prompt. Some
communications also involve TCP sockets.

<br><br>

If you intend to use to several kernels, please create alternate directories
and set SPOTON_HOME accordingly.
