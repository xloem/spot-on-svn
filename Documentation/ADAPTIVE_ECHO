Adaptive Echo

Adaptive Echo allows auxiliary nodes to direct data via pseudo-private
tokens. Please consider the following example.

Let A, B, C, and D be four auxiliary nodes and let a, b, c, and d be four
private nodes.

Suppose the network topology is as follows (a drawing will help):

a – A – B – b
B – C – c
C – D – d

Let t_B_1 and t_B_2 be two tokens that B is aware of.

Suppose none of the private nodes know the tokens. If so, all echo
communications will behave as they would do without Adaptive Echo.

Now suppose that node a and node d know t_B_1. As B begins to receive echo
data from A and C, it will become aware that A and C are aware of t_B_1.
Once it establishes this knowledge, it will direct traffic having special
signatures from A to C and from C to A. Until node b provides a special
signature, it will not receive data from either A or C if that data includes
the special signature. Although nodes b and c do not know t_B_1, they will be
able to communicate via B.
