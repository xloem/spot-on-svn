Adaptive Echo

Adaptive Echo allows auxiliary nodes to direct data via pseudo-private
tokens. Please consider the following example.

Let A, B, C, and D be four auxiliary nodes and let a, b, c, and d be four
private nodes.

Suppose the network topology is as follows (a drawing will help):

a – A – B – b
B – C – c
C – D – d

Let t_b_1 and t_b_2 be two tokens that B is aware of.

Suppose none of the private nodes know the tokens. If so, all echo communications will
behave as they would do without Adaptive Echo.

Now suppose that node a and node d know t_b_1. As B begins to receive echo
data from A and C, it will become aware that A and C are aware of t_b_1.
Once it establishes this knowledge, it will direct traffic having special signatures from A to
C and from C to A. Until node b provides a special signature, it will not receive data
from either A or C if that data includes the special signature. Although nodes b and c do not
know t_b_1, they will be able to communicate via B.
