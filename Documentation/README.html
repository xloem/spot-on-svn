<p>(You find these files as well in the source code, which is added to the installer.) </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">1. What is Spot-On?</p>
<p>Spot-On is an anonymous and encrypted distributed search engine. It includes chat and email options to friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>The search is done in your local database, which is synchronized with all neighbors and friends. This means, no queryhit or search term from you will be exposed to others in the network. To have good search results, you collect several Gigabyte of Data. </p>
<p class="Stil1">==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">2. Settings: Starting the App</p>
<p>After installing the applicaton start Spot-On. All Tabs are disabled, only the Settings page can be accessed. Here you need at first to set the passphrase. </p>
<p class="Stil2"><strong>2.1. Set a Passphrase</strong></p>
<p>Choose   a passphrase enter it twice. The passphrase must be at least 16 characters. Press the Button &quot;Set Passphrase&quot;.</p>
<p>Look at the status bar and be patient. The encryption keys will be generated. The higher the RSA Size is chosen, the longer is the time for the creation of the keys. On the other hand: the higher the RSA Size (e.g. 3072) the more secure is the encryption. When done, you see a pop up. Another pop up asks you to activate the kernel. In case all is set up right, you now can activate the kernel. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.2. Kernel Path</strong></p>
<p>The path to the executeable kernel of Spot-On needs to be set. For windows this is the file &quot;Spot-On-Kernel.exe&quot;. You can find it in the same install direcory, where the &quot;Spon-On.exe&quot; for the Graphical User interface is found. In case the path is set right, the background color of the path-information is set to green. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.3. Kernel Activation</strong></p>
<p>In case you have generated a password,  the kernel can be activated. Just press the button &quot;Activate&quot;. You need to have the kernel running in case you want to use Spot-On. You can also deactivate the kernel or close the graphical user interface (gui). If you close the gui, the kernel keeps running, if not deactivated.</p>
<p>Currently the gui and the kernel communicate only on the same local system with two, internally an automatically chosen ports. As soon as a secured communication between kernel and gui has been established, it will be possible to have the kernel on a webserver and to connect with as many dislocated guis with the kernel. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.4. Set a Listener</strong></p>
<p>Without a listener your friends cannot connect to you! So, for a better connectivity you should set up and define a listener. A listener is always set on the local device, hence you need the local IP address of your machine. This is normally the 192.168... number and not your external IPa address. The port is default for Spot-On 4710. You can use the pull down menu to choose a &quot;custom&quot; defined local device ip - or to chose from the locally found IP addresses. In case you are unsure, if you should use &quot;127.1.0.0&quot; (localhost) or any other given address, you can set up as well several listener.  </p>
<p>In case you want to sent your IP Adress to another user, be sure, you have set up a listener, who is able to handle as many as desired connections. In case you allow only 5 connections on your listener, and the other neighbors have taken these slots, you cannot send your IP to new friends, as there is no slot given anymore. Please set in that case the &quot;maximum allowed number of neighbor-connections&quot; to infinite. </p>
<p>Make sure, that each listener has an own, different port. </p>
<p>Never add an IP addres you get from your friend or neighbor into the IP Box for the listener creation. A Listener is aways your local ip of your local device. As well it is not your exteral IP of the router, which your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assignes to you. </p>
<p>The listener creation process supports IPv6. Check the radio button for IPv6 and use the pull down menu for the IPs. Many users and routers already have a hybrid set, which includes an IPv6 address. In case an IPv6 adress shows up, add it as a listener too, it will increase the connectivity to your friends.</p>
<p>Every IPv6 address, except the unspecified address (::), has a &quot;scope&quot; ID, which specifies in which part of the network it is valid [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4007]. E.g. you are getting the IPv6 address as fe80::71a3:2b00:ddd3:753f%16. The number after the '%' is the scope ID.</p>
<p>IPv6 defines at least three reachability scopes for addresses:</p>
<p> 1. Globally addressable. This is an IPv6 address given to you by your ISP. It is available to use on the public Internet.</p>
<p> 2. Link-local. This is similar to the 169.254.X.X range. It is an address that a computer assigns itself in order to facilitate local communications. These addresses don't get routed around on the public Internet because they're not globally unique.</p>
<p> 3. Node-local. This is an address that identifies the local interface, similar to 127.0.0.1. Basically, this scope ID is the address ::1.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses with the prefix fe80::/64 are link-local addresses that are constructed by combining that prefix with the hardware address of the network device, 71a3:2b00:ddd3:753f in an example. (The analog in IPv4 is 169.254.0.0/16.) <br>
  On Windows, %16 is interface number 16; on Linux for example you might see something like %eth0.<br>
</p>
<p>  <br>
  <span class="Stil2">2.5. Forward Port in your Router</span></p>
<p>In many countries a router or nat is used at home behind the DSL line of the Internet Service Provider. You need to forward one port (e.g. 4710) to the IP of your local device (e.g. again with Port 4710). Look into the description of your router, how to do that. Forwarding a port enables other users to be able to use that port to connect to the port of the application of the local device behind that router. The port will only accept incoming requests for that application, so no one can use this port for different purposes. It is a well known method. </p>
<p>Choosing UPNP causes each time a new port a connection is done, so this is not recommended, as the client of your friend or of other neighbors then do not know this port. Please use a defined Port and forward it in your router. As long as a DHT is not implemented, ideally with a stable IP address. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.6. Reset Spot-On</strong> </p>
<p>In case you press the button &quot;Reset Spot-On&quot; you will be asked, if spot should  clean everything or selected items within the Spot-On-Setup. It is like a new re-install. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">3. Add a Neighbor</p>
<p>Adding a Neighbor is easy. Spot-On automatically connects to the Spot-On Community and adds new Neighbors to your Database.</p>
<p>You can run Spot-On in two way, either you connect to the community, or, you connect only to your Sticky-Friends. New users should first un-check the check box &quot;Connect only to Sticky Neighbors&quot;, as this introduces a friend-to-friend net, rather than a peer-to-peer net. Running in a fried-to-friend network, you need at least 3-5 friends being constant online, to have good results. So lets start with the peer-to-peer network connection first. </p>
<p class="Stil2">3.1. Add Neighbor Button </p>
<p>In case you run in your neighbor database out of actual neighbor IP addresses, you can enter one IP manually. The connection requires two users having a Spot-On installation ideally with a set up listener and forwarded port (see above) running. Otherwise ask within the user and developer community to provide to yout with a fresh online IP address and Port. Spot-On supports IPv6 Adresses. Once connected to another user, please use the Button &quot;Fetch More&quot; to get some more IP adresses from this user. Don&acute;t add a neighbor IP into your listener IP box. </p>
<p class="Stil2">3.2. Show only connected neighbors (Check Box) </p>
<p>This check box shows in the neighbor table onyl those neighbors, which are connected to you. All not connected neighbors still waiting for a connection try show up only, if the connection has been successful. </p>
<p class="Stil2">3.3. Context Menu: Connect </p>
<p>Un-check both check boxes: &quot;Connect only to Sticky neighours&quot; and &quot;Show only online neighbors&quot;. Then you should see your entered IP adress in the table. A click with the mouse into the table selects the row with the IP Addess. Right mouse click enables the context menu and if you choose the entry &quot;Connect&quot; you can manually force the connection process to this IP. After a few seconds the Graphical User Interface should show you the green highligthed online status of the connection. </p>
<p>In case no connection is established, the IP address is not online or firewalled or has not set up a listener or forwarded a port in the router. Try another IP address to connect with the context menu or set up the other IP in the right way to accept a listener. </p>
<p class="Stil2">3.4. Fetch More Button </p>
<p>Spot-On automatically sends you every few minutes  some IP adresses from your connected neighbors. This process should keep your neighbors database up to date. The Button &quot;Fetch More&quot; starts this process manually at the given point of time, to transfer from the connected neighbor several IP adresses, so that you can connect to several neighbors. Please check, that you have not the check box &quot;Connect only to Sticky Neigbors&quot; activated, because this excludes other new neighbors in your connection process.</p>
<p class="Stil2">3.5. Connect only to sticky neighbors (check Box) </p>
<p>If you don&acute;t want to connect to the Spot-On community via the peer-to-peer network, you can choose to ask your friends with a stable or dedicated IP address to connect to you exclusively. As this requires an implemented DHT or a stable IP address for both users, it is recommended to join the Spot-On peer-to-peer community first. In detail there is of course - depending on the usage case - of course a technical difference in a Web-Of-Trust (friend-to-friend) network or an OpenNet (p2p network). Due to the fact, that all transfers are encrypted, there should be no difference in connecting to an exclusive friend or random peer. </p>
<p class="Stil2">3.6. Country Inclusion </p>
<p>The splitter in the right side of the Neighbors Tab opens the side bar: Country Inclusion. For a better connectivity make sure, each country, especially your own country, is checked. If a checkbox is un-checked, a connection to an IP-address out of this country will not be possible and denied. In case your friends are only from your own country, it could be a help to steer the echoed messages only to neighbors from your own country. This increases the Time-To-Live (TTL) for your messages and makes it more efficient to have the messages &quot;traveling&quot; not abroad. On the other hand, if you have multinational friends or family, you can help to exchange messages worldwide in the p2p network, if you keep all countries checked. If you uncheck-connections within neighbors from  country XY, you have as well a kind of sticky definition: Connect to neighbors out of the rest of the world (or selected countries), instead of neighbors out of  country XY. You yourself define, how your friendship is defined and to which and how many neighbors you want to connect. That&acute;s like in real life: a personal setting. Some community boards like the TOR community report, that they help emerging countries - due to underdeveloped bandwith and IT infrastructure like in Afrika - to improve their internet messaging with providing a Spot-On kernel on a webserver dedicate for neighbors just from that or any other specific country. For a home user it is recommended, to keep every country checked and included. </p>
<p>Futhermore for the URL exchange, you might want URLs, which are in the same language of your own country. Though every user will have international sets of URLs, like central search engines offer as well URLs from all over the world, it should not matter, if you get an URL to a  webpage in a foreign language from a  friend in a different or your own country - or, deny the connection to neighbours from that foreign coutry. The internet is global. So is Spot-On. The country inclusion allows to refine the language, websites of URLs might have, which you get from neighbors. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">4. Add a Friend</p>
<p>Even in case you have set up and maintain enough connections to neigbors in the peer-to-peer Modus, you can still add friends to your communication tools like chat and email. </p>
<p>To add a friend, there are two methods: Either you connect to the friend with a direct IP connection, then you share your keys and make permanent friends, or you have not a direct IP connection to our friend, then you exchange the &quot;Repleo&quot;. Repleo is an new method to add friends by an encryption certificate, which is based on the protocols Spot-On maintains.</p>
<p>So lets start with the explanation of the Repleo Exchange. We assume you have Spot-On already connected to some neighbors. If you have only your friend as a neighbor connected, please chose the method &quot;Key Exchange&quot; instead. </p>
<p class="Stil2"> <strong>4.1. <b>Repleo Exchange</b></strong>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain the key from your friend. Paste it and press the Add button.</li>
  <li>Go to Chat Tab: Participants Table: Copy your Repleo for this friend from the context menu.</li>
  <li>Send this Repleo to your friend, who paste and adds it.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>As a result: Your friend is not sticky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Stil2"><strong>4.2. Alternatively: <b>Key Exchange</b> via IP Connection</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a listener. Forward the Port in your Router/Nat.</li>
  <li>Send IP/Port to your friend. Add Neighbor: Insert IP.</li>
  <li>Once connected, both users share the key via the context menu in the Neighbors IP-table. (or: Share Key Button).</li>
  <li>Go to Chat Tab: Participants Table: Approve of new chat friends via the context menu: &quot;Add as Friends&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>As a result: Your friend is made a sticky Neighbor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&acute;s describe the above given process steps in words. </p>
<p> Bob wants to add Alice as friend.
Bob shares his public key with Alice: Bob copies the key, sends it per email to Alice and Alice adds the key. Alice then switches to the Chat Tab and Bob is as a user shown in the participants list. Right mouseclick on Bob opens the context menu: Click on &quot;Copy Repleo&quot; and this is the specific Repleo generated for Bob. (The Repleo includes Bobs public key (encrypted) and the symmetric information (encrypted) and this kind op zip is generated to a base-64 string text, nothing binary).</p>
<p>Alice sends it to Bob. Bob adds the Repleo to the Add-Friends-box and presses the button &quot;Add Friend&quot;. Now they're both known. Done.</p>
<p>This is just a copy and paste mechanism. You can share your key in regular e-mail to me. Or whatever. I add it. Generate the Repleo for you and send it back and it is added too. So the Repleo process is a three step: SEND KEY - CREATE BUNDE - SEND BACK. And it does not need any connection in the Spot-On network. </p>
<p>In case you already have neighbors, you should be able to chat with your friend.</p>
<p>The Key-Exchange via a direct IP connection to your friend requires, that you are connecting to your friend.</p>
<p>Alice sends her IP Address and Port to Bob. Bob adds both information to the Add Neighbor Box and presses the button: Add Neighbor.</p>
<p>Now Alice&acute; IP-adress appears in the IP-connection table of the neighbors tab. After a few seconds Spot-On tries to connect. As well you can manually start the connection process with the context menu: right mouseclick on the row with the IP adreess of Alice: connect. </p>
<p>In case no connection is established, there is something wrong either with your machine configuration or Alice has not Forwarded Port and Crated a Listener. As the HTTP-Protocol is used, the problem should not be on Bobs side, as he can use any browser as well. Now Alice needs to create a proper listener and forward the port in the router. As well Bob can try to set up a listener and forward the port in the router too. Then Alice needs to add Bobs IP.</p>
<p>When afterall connected, both, Alice and Box press the button &quot;Share Key&quot;. (Alternativeley use the contect menu &quot;Share Key&quot;). When both have shared the key, go to the chat tab. In the participants table list you see a new friend. As well over the context menu choose: Make Friends and the Friends gets a different Icon. You are now added as Friends and can chat. </p>
<p>Well, in case you cannot connect directly to your friend, try the Repleo Exchange as descibed above. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">5. Chat</p>
<p>Chat is functional and simple.Activate the kernel, See some neighbors connecting, and your friends in the participants list of the chat tab will show up some presence information. </p>
<p>Blue Icon: Away, Red Icon: Busy, LightGreen Icon: Online. Grey Icon: Offline. </p>
<p>To chat to one online friend, select the participant and type into the message box and hit return on your keyboard or press the button &quot;Send&quot;. To send a chat message to all friends, you can click in the table cell of the participants table in the left top corner (next to the header of the table). As well  set a chat name above the participants list. </p>
<p>The Chat protocol works this way: </p>
<p>You write a message, this message is encrypted with the public key of your chat partner. Before it is encrypted, the messages as a string is hashed. The hash is added to the encrypted message. Both is generated to a base-64 string and send via HTTP to all your friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>These neighbours toogle the base-64 back to a hash and an encrypted message. Then they try to decrypt the message and generate a hash for the message. If both hashes match the sent hash, then the message is for this destination. In all other cases, the messages and the hash are sent again to all friends and neighbors. This is done as often as by a Time-To-Live (TTL) number suggested. This TTL is added on the plaintext level, so not in the encrypted message.</p>
<p>Sending of Messages will stop, if either TTL = 0 or the delivered Hash and the Hash of the decrypted message match.</p>
<p>That means, everyone is sending a message to everyone. To avoid loops and reduce bandwidth, each incoming message is hashed (again, third hash process) and this hash is stored in a RAM-Cache. When you already have re-sent a hash of a message, you will stop as well as it is redundant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook: Of course, the more users and the more connections are maintained and the more messages are witten, the more bandwidth and fast processing computers are needed. Today this is no problem and small text messages are sent fast. Sticky Friends and the integration of IRC Rooms (to be done) based on this protocol will help to reach the friends over a few hops. Currently a TTL of 16 is defined. Within 16 hops you need to reach the friend. So if your friend is online and you do not see this presence information, the TTL might be out of reach. Find a third common friend, which is near you both. For that, the Sticky Neighbor concept has been introduced. A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) (to be done) will find the friend - even with a new updated IP address. But let&acute;s stay practical: Test the chat with a few friends while connected to some neighbors. It should work. In detail this means: one user from an Moon-Country  with a connection to a user from an Mars-Country .... and so on with a connection to a user from an Earth-Country  can chat with this friend over the users in the Middle-Ware-Cosmos. As everything  is encrypted and for Chat done in RAM, this transgalactic process delivers the message only for the friend, who is addressed. You can help to improve chat with setting up and running a Spot-On  with listener or by contribution of source code for a DHT or an IRC Room based on the echo protocol. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">6. Offline Email</p>
<p>When friends are online, you can use the Chat Tab to communicate and chat with them. In case they are offline, you can send a kind of email. Go to the Email Tab. A horizontal splitter shows you on top the incomming messages and in the bottum you can write your own messages. You can only write email messages to friends, which are defined as a friend in the participants list of your Chat Tab. That means, you need to exchange Key and Repleo first, if you want to use Spot-On as a secure and encrypted email system. </p>
<p>Email is using the same protocol like chat messages, though an own message type is used. Spot-On Emails  have a double encrypted envelope.</p>
<p>The first envelope is like a chat message. As the friend appears to be offline, a third common friend is asked, to store the message, until the recipient comes online. For that, the encrypted message with the plaintext hash, TTL and &quot;Messagetype:Chat&quot; (lets call it envelope1) is again encrypted and this gets added: an ID, a new Messagetype:Email plus hash of the envelope1 and TTL, so the result is an evelope2 (Kind of Chat Envelope in an Email Envelope). The added ID is the hash of the key of the receiver. The message is sent to all friends you have in your participants list. When a third common friend gets the message, the MessageTye:Email informs the friend, that this is a message for storage and not for echo, so the traveling stops here. The third common friends stores it in an ecnryped email database until the receiving friend comes online. If the online coming Friends hash of his key matches the stored ID, then the third common friend delivers the message with the protocol of a normal chat message, just with the messagetype:Email (so that is arrives not in the Chat Tab, but in the Email Tab.) </p>
<p>As a third common friend has as well like you the public key of the receiver, it is not a problem to use the Hash of this key to write on the second envelope, to which the encrypted content (envelope1) should be delivered. Neihbors do not store emails, because they do not know the public key of the receiver. Simply, it is like a postal voting system: Put your vote in an envelope, send this envelop in another envelope to the voting bureau, which is opening the first envelop at the desired time and addresses the inner envelope as a message to the desired party. </p>
<p>The more friends you have, which know each other (networking), the more you help, that they can exchange offline emails. Some users set up a common webserver with an always-on Spot-On Kernel as a mailbox on it. The middle ware allows all friends of this kernel, to use the email system. Not necessarily the third common friend must be a direct neighbor. It just needs to be a common friend. The simple answer for freedom of data retention is +1 Echo-TTL. Just add one Spot. It might be your Spot and you make a difference. Done. </p>
<p class="Stil2">6.1 Email / Blog &quot;to all participants&quot;</p>
<p>Use the pull down menu to write a text &quot;to all participants&quot;. This is either an email to all, an email-mailinglist-like announcement letter, or a micro-blog function. Publish your public key on your website, users will add the key into Spot-On and the Repleo is sent inside Spot-On to you Spot-On-Email-Account. Add all subscription requests of the users, your audience. Now you are able to blog to all subscribed participants. They just need your key. With the echo protocol your free speech is  IP-less. Hence, Spot-On has some potentials for all users, to open up micro-blogs inside Spot-On and/or to read subscribed email letters. Furthermore mailinglists can be created with the functionality &quot;Email to all participants&quot; without any maintanance-need from technical or thrid party side. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">7. Local Search of URLs </p>
<p>Spot-On&acute;s main function is to synchonize a Database of URLs amoung connected and related friends and neighbours. Every user has a database for URLs. This database can grow as big as the user wants. Several Gigabytes are enough, to have valid search results. Of course there are some distributed search engines for URLs, but Spot-On is different: With Spot-On you do not send out to a server or other users a search term, hence you do not generate a queryhit in other peers. With Spot-On you search only on localhost your own local data.</p>
<p>The tranfer of URLS are encrypted, no Internet Service Provider can look into the encrypted Data.  Currently the search term result page lists all matched by the used keyword(s) and the timestamp. Please refine your search by adding more keywords. The Results Display Algorithm will be refined continously.</p>
<p>Modern smaller central and serverbased search engines have 16 GB of URLs. Today this is not much space and every mobile device has such a capacity. So for your desktop you can allow some space too. 200 Million of URL and more can be represented by that way. Due to the online connection to other neighbors, you get new and fresh URLs instantly. First, the decentral URL network has to be stablished for a valid URL database, then the algorithm of the generation of search results can be improved. While many people contribute within the wikipedia to an open source encyclopedia, there is the belief, that as well for searching the web, not only the search engine should be open source, but as well the URL database should be long into the hand of the users. Within communityboards users report of over 100 GB of URLs in their Spot-On Database, which they share to other users. </p>
<p>Currently SQLite is used as a database, additonal PostGres-Support  for bigger URL Databases within Spot-On has still to be developed (to be done). A setup of several installations though is possible as well, as it is a distributed network. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">8. Add URLs with a Feeder</p>
<p>URLs can be added to Spot-On in many ways: First, connect to neighbors and friends and be constant online. Your Database then will fill with URLs and the bigger your database, the more and better search results you get. In case you have a bad search experience: Be sure it is your own database :-P. YOU are responsible to maintain connections and feeds to your database.</p>
<p>Several third party apps are able to send URLs to Spot-On. While the URLs in Spot-On are stored in URL001.db, Feeded URLs are added to: SHARED.db. This database is regulary grabbed by libspoton / Spot-ON to add the URLs to the network. Appications like Dooble Web Browser or Arado RSS Reader or, third a Crawler are currently able to feed URLs to SHARED.db. </p>
<p>E.g. the Web Browser Dooble: You find in the Dooble Install on the Bookmark and History Pop Up a Button: Spot-On. By pressing this Button, you send the selected URLs to your Spot-On Installation. Your URLs are added to the Spot-On-Network and everyone participating can search for this URL.</p>
<p>Hint: You need to set the path to SHARED.db in Dooble Browser/Settings/Start-Portals: Last entry on that page: Path for Spot-On SHARED.db.</p>
<p>Please set the path to your Spot-On Installation. You find the SHARED.DB in the &quot;.Spot-on&quot; subpath of the install-directory of Spot-On. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">9.  Connections &amp; Transfer </p>
<p>While for URLs this claim is the goal: Everyone has Every URL, hence search yourself locally. This is as well for the messaging protocol, called the echo-protocol, one essence: Every users send every message to every friend and neihbor. Everyone has everything, until the Time-to-Live has reached its end. </p>
<p>First: </p>
<p>The message deliver process - sending everyone everything - is  like a tale or rumor on the market place. All participants on the marketplace on the mars know the tale and one person driving to the marketplace on the moon, can start to tell the tale again. It is like the bible says: look at everything, and keep the good, or: what you can read and understand. It is an encyclopaedic principle, read everything, and work with what you can read, understand and what you need.</p>
<p>Second: </p>
<p>There is an IP-Less destionation or Address given with the encryption key (public key). you just communicate with your neighbour, you have no destionation information on the message and you have no IP in the HTTP header of the destination or the sender, you just communnicate with your neighbours one to one. With the echo protocol you dont have a true destination, that is why it is not forwarding or a routing concept. Forwarding means, you use an address of the destination (to which you then forward or route). So the term is more a Middle Ware. </p>
<p>That means, you have the same messaging concept like with http, if user A is connecting to a bulletin board and sending a message within this board to User B. Or: User A is connecting via HTTP to Middleware Socialnet.com and sending User B a message on that platform. Socialnet is sending then the HTTP Header to user B. New in the echo concept is, that User B is free to send the news to all the friends and neighbors. In real life it is called &quot;tale&quot;, &quot;story&quot; or &quot;rumor&quot;. News spreads like wildfire to everyone.</p>
<p>Third, for URLs: </p>
<p>The original idea was to encrypt all URLs that I am about to send via URL public keys.<br>
To do this, Spot-On must partition the URLs. Instead of partitioning URLs, the process is now like following: Now Spot-On assigns session keys with each public key. The session key is encrypted with the public key. The URL is encrypted with the session key. The session key is symmetric.The message is the session key and the URL. So .... the message includes the encrypted session key and the encrypted URL. Only those who have the correct private key can decrypt both. First they decrypt the session key via their private key and then they decrypt the URL with the symmetric key.</p>
<p>So it is something without partitioning. In order to get the content, someone need to break PGP, to get the symmetric key and decrypt the URL (ideally with the right key). So it is a locked box that contains a key to open another box. That is the encrypted URL users are exchanging.<br>
</p>
<p>For URL exchange a second  private public keypair is used. It is different from that one generated for chat. </p>
<p>The URL-Key is a different than the Chat-Key. Users only can and need to copy out the chat key. The URL-Keys are exchnaged automatically: Two connected users get and exchange all - really all - their URL public keys. That is called the Pollen Effect. Like a bee is flying from flower to flower, all your neighbours send you URL-Keys of their neighbors. So in any case you connect to a new neighbor, you get new keys and already have the public URL-Key of your just connecte neighbor. You are now able to exchange URLs with the new connected neighbor. Its an Exchange. Even if two users are not friends. You just don't know it, wether you are friends or neigbors or echoed nodes. URLs will come in from all your connections and friends.<br>
</p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">10. URL Cultivation </p>
<p>With Spot-On you will get many URLs. In any case, you can delete any URL you want from your local database. Just use the Delete Button on the Search Tab. Furthermore, you might want to define, which URLs you want to download and/or upload. The Tab URL Cultivation allows you to set Destillers (Filters). E.g. you only want to receive URLS which start with http://wikipedia.oirg/.... then you set your Distiller for that for the download, and your database will be filled only with URLS from Wikipedia. You are a Wikipedia-Search engine then and can deliver to your friends or sticky neigbours a clean database of only Wikipedia URLs. This is a coporate view of an URL Database supplier. Though, normally a user is searching for everything and need every URL. For that, ideally set no Distiller for downloads. Then you get every URL. As everything is encrypted and local search is done, this is the easiest way, to have a huge Database of URLs.</p>
<p>In case you want to upload not every URL to your friends, you can set up as well a Distiller for Upload. But: The connecton would be a waste of bandwidth, if Alice filters within the upload  only URLs from the english Wikipedia and Bob filters in his download only URLs from the chinese Wikipedia, all transfers are discarded. Furthermore no one can be accused to know, write down, or communicate a string beginning with &quot;HTTP://...&quot;. It is like a scientific quotation of a bibliograhic information. A bibliographic information does not mean, you have read the book, have it physically, or  (re-)publish the book.</p>
<p>An URL is just metadata. Transferred and stored in an encrypted environment. There should be no need to set a distiller for upload. In case you want to keep your own database clean, you could exclude some domains for the download process. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">11. Protocol </p>
<p>The Echo Protocol works on the idea that if you can decipher the message and the message fits the hash, it is intended for you. OK, so Alice sends 0000-HASH-HELLO. 0000 defines the Message type: Chat. The Message is HELLO. And the HASH is the hash of the message. Assume the hash of HELLO is ABCD. That is the Plaintext. </p>
<p>Now Alice encrypts the Message with the public key of Bob, &quot;HELLO&quot; is transformed into e.g. &quot;12345&quot;. And a Time-To-Live-Number is added. e.g. 16. </p>
<p>Alice wraps the following: 12345+ABCD+0000+TTL16</p>
<p>This created message is sent to every friend and neighbor. </p>
<p>And Bob decodes that, because he has the the righ key, he decode the message: MESSAGE=Hello, Bob generates the HASH of it and it seems: HASH=ABCD. The HASH of the message of Bobs local computing (&quot;ABCD&quot;) is the same as the  as the delivered HASH of the Message (&quot;ABCD&quot;).</p>
<p>Bob gets the message displayed and stops sending the message to other neighbors and friends. </p>
<p>The chance that you get 0000HASHHELLO after decoding it is small. Only Bob can decode it. </p>
<p>Peter has a different public key, he gets the message as well and uses his key: the MESSAGE &quot;12345&quot; decrypts into: ABIENTOT. Peter generates the hash of the string &quot;ABIENTOT&quot; and the hash of that word is &quot;MNOP&quot;. Now Peter compares the delivered Hash &quot;ABCD&quot; with his computed hash for the decrypted word &quot;ABIENTOT&quot;, which is: &quot;MNOP&quot;. ABCD != MNOP. That means, the message is decoded wrong and not for Peter.</p>
<p>Peter forwards the message as follows to all friends and neighbors: 12345+ABCD+0000+TTL15.</p>
<p>Reduce by one Time-to-Live-Step = 15. </p>
<p>  Spot On  also has to remind users that they will be acting as middle ware. there is some traffic to be expected, as messages will come in, which are not for you. In a simple sentence: So, you receive a POST. You decompose it, and if you understand it, it's yours. If not, you POST it to all other nodes connected.</p>
<p>One basic of the protocol is futhermore, that only HTTP transfers are used, PUT and GET, and second that the wrap &quot;12345+ABCD+0000+TTL16&quot; is encoded to Base64, which is a Text String of generated characters like: &quot;9f93jf0s30fj49d80lj3o9dn309fj69dk30..&quot;. The receiver needs to re-code from Base64 to &quot;12345+ABCD+0000+TTL16&quot; and start the above described process. </p>
<p>The most effective way to deliver messages is, that a friend is a neighbour (&quot;Sticky-Modus&quot;), then messages are decoded immediately and not forwarded.<br>
In case your friend is not connected with an IP as a neighbour, the message decoding fails and will be forwarded to all connected nodes. A Time To live TTL = 16 will a allow a wide spread of the message. Spot-On will make you sure, that your messages is delivered: and that  your voice is heard by your addressed receiver. If there is a path, Spot-on will find it with the echo protocol. Spot, the communicative pathfinder.</p>
<p>So virtual friends need just to make sure, that they have within their hops of 15 left distances a common friend/neighbor as well. To connect the route for virtual friends, you ideally have some sticky neighbours with a stable IP or DNS Node or a third common sticky friend </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">12. Encryption</p>
<p>For Encryption two pairs of public/private keys are used: One pair for chat and communication, one for Transfer of URLs. Additionally a smmetric key can be deployed. That means, you create a channel within a channel. </p>
<p>To secure the chat, the keyed-hashes are interesting. Because sha512_k('hello') != sha512('hello'). And sha512_k1('hello') != sha512_k2('hello').</p>
<p>When two users (Peter and Bob) connect, and write the message = HELLO, then then hashes are different as if Peter and Paul write the same Message &quot;HELLO&quot;. </p>
<p>The usage of a public encryption key, secure with a symmetric key, hash-checks with keyed-hashed, all wraped in an envelope, for email again running thought this process, and then all that tranformed to a base-64 string make the chat and email within Spot-On quite secure. As even your public key is only known by your friends (different in a web of trust with key rings), the sticky modus and the concept of Spot-On does not expose these commuication keys. </p>
<p>All Databases stored on your local machine are as well encrypted. Of course, some users still might create an installation of Spot-On in an TrueCrypt-encrypted container or hard disk. But this is normally not needed. </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">13. Believe in Features </p>
<p>Why Spot-On with technically advanced and modern features needs to be supported by your contribution. </p>
<p class="Stil2">13.1. <STRONG>Easy Usage of the  Spot-on <STRONG>web search </STRONG>e.g. in the Web Browser Dooble </STRONG></p>
<p>For an integrated user-experience Spot-On is implemented as a websearch engine in the Web Browser <A href="http://dooble.sf.net" target="_blank">http://dooble.sf.net</A> (next to Google, Wikipedia, Metager, YaCy, Ixquick and others).         (For developers of other applications the c++-library libspoton is provided as an open source resource).</p>
<p><em>Some people in the Spot-On Community believe that there is the need for an alternative search engine, which should be easy accessible for the users. To help to collect URLs this is ideally done within a web browser. Therefor Spot-On implemented libspoton in the open source browser Dooble, which has  a lot of privacy and security features. Of course libspoton is an easy to use library, other developers as well can implement in their software applications. </em></p>
<p class="Stil2"><STRONG>13.2. Collecting URLs within a huge and growing Spot-On community </STRONG></p>
<p>While you browse the web you can send defined URLs to the your own local database. (It&acute;s easy like creating a bookmark of a webpage, you currently read).                 In contact with other Spot-on-user the URLs of websites you like are exchanged.                 It&acute;s a community-movement to contribute to an open source websearch engine, similar to the wikipedia style. Every user is now able to add the own favourite websites to the spot-on-community.        The connections to other community members are secured and encrypted.</p>
<p><em>Some people in the Spot-On Community believe that the userbased movement of wikipedia is a great success. Everyone contributing a small part helps to let the basis grow. There have been already several initiatives to extend the user-generated content as well to an URL database for web search. Spot-on has been programmed and released now to enable every internet user to contribute to this open source web search engine and open source database. Collecting URLs to provide a web search is done within a community of solidarity. If you "Like" a website / URL, send it as well to Spot-on and share it with the community. </em></p>
<p class="Stil2"><STRONG>13.3. Search Yourself. Generating your local Database: 20 Millions URS in 16 GB</STRONG></p>
<p>The result: you create with the exchange of other users a HUGE Database with URLs of e.g. 16 GB or even 32 GB. This is a small amount of Data, you can store on your hard disk or even on a mobile SD-Card - But it contains 20 Million URLs and more.                         Your local database of 20 Mio URLs allows to search the Web. You own the search engine and the database now.                        The Search Engine and the Database is open source. The Data is generated by Users.</p>
<p><em>Some people in the Spot-On Community believe that technically and web search architecture is appropriate, in which everyone own every URL. Computers, even mobile Devices and SD-Cards have enough GB of storage, to generate a local database on your device with 20 GB, which are dozen of URLs. Today every user can run an own search engine and hold the database for it. Spot-On is a local database, you do not search other servers, you search yourself. That means others don&acute;t see your search terms and don&acute;t define the filters for you, what you should see or get. There is no central instance or authority which tracks your web search behaviours or defines your given results. Everything is local on your chip. </em></p>
<p class="Stil2">13.4. Privacy &amp; Transparency: Spot-on is based on a worldwide unique P2P web search architecture and user movement </p>
<p>This is worldwide a new concept: Public p2p search engines are just two others given, yacy and faroo (closed source and commercial driven),  Spot-On has no problem to mention these similar architectures here.                But both expose your search terms in to others nodes, user and servers.                Spot-On is unique, different and offers a worldwide new concept:        You generate no query hits in other nodes or servers. What you search is totally private and anonymous. You only search your local database. </p>
<p><em>Some people in the Spot-On Community believe that web search is an essential process for education, to read the web and to explore new content. This should be done with open source search engines and with an open source database. Privacy and tansparency guarantee a free human constitution within these learning processes. Much more important is the ability, that users can contribute to help others to learn and search the web. Beeing a part of the hole community. Big, central search engines do a good job in delivering pre-defined content-links - but with side effects of tracking users interests, bubbling results, advertising and priorising URLs. There is a community, which helps to create an alternative. To contribute to an open source websearch. </em></p>
<p class="Stil2">13.5. The Echo-Protocol </p>
<p>The Echo Protocol works on the idea, that if you can decipher the message and the message fits the  hash, it is intended for you. So in simple words: You receive a POST. You decompose it, and if you understand it, it's yours. If not, you post it to all other nodes connected.</p>
<p> <em>Some people in the Spot-On Community believe that a messaging protocol is needed, that will make you sure, that your messages is delivered: and that  your voice is heard by your addressed receiver. If there is a path, Spot-On will find it with the echo protocol. Spot-On, the communicative pathfinder.</em></p>
<p class="Stil2">13.6. Let&acute;s spot it: Be part of building a userbased web search with Spot-on. </p>
<p>Libspoton exchanges URLs, not Search Terms.        This means you get no filtered and commercially driven customized results. Nothing is founded on a tracking of your search and browse behaviours.                        Get all the URLs and search yourself. Search your local datafile with 20 Million URLS in 20 GB with spot-on. Install your Spot-On URL Database now and search yourself. Contribute with your URLs to the Community. It&acute;s implemented in the Web Browser Dooble. Easy to use, open source, ready for your participation to build a userbased web search. </p>
<p><em>Some people in the Spot-On Community believe in you. Only the community of users have created the distributed URL database. And it is growing and growing. Be part of it and be sure, that search results are convenient to use, not earlier before you have more than 16 GB of URLS stored on your local machine. Every URL you add to Spot-On helps others to grow their database as well.</em></p>

<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">14. FAQ</p>
<p class="Stil2">14.1. Will there be a mobile GUI possible? </p>
<p>Yes, currently a Android App gui might be worked out: Two ways are possible. A remot gui to a kernel somewhere on a webserver or even running the kernel on the mobile device. But before that can be finished, the connection of the gui and kernel needs to be secure with SSH (currently both on a localhost) and the processing of messagetypes need to be differentiated, so that e.g. mobile devices only process chat messages. </p>
<p class="Stil2">14.2. Is FileSharing with this protocol possible? </p>
<p>Needs to have further study. </p>
<p class="Stil2">14.3. How are IRC rooms possible? </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.4. How is Spot-on integrated in the web browser Dooble? </p>
<p align="left">Install the web browser Dooble and check in the Settings, if Spot-on is enabled. When you surf, you have the option to send the URL of the website to your local database Spot-on. As well you can set as an option, that automatically all browsed, bookmark or cached URLs are sent to your local database Spot-on. For security reasons all Https-URLs are shortend to the domain only, so that individual loggin-URLs are not shared. That means, the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websearch" will be shortend to "http://en.wikipedia.org". </p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.5. Can other applications as well share URLs to Spot-on?</p>
<p align="left">Yes, any other application, we call it "feeder", can contribute and share URLs to your local Spot-on database. In the web browser Dooble you see under settings a database called "Shared.db" which is part of the browser. You first send your URLs, you want to share with the community, to this database. Then Spot-on is looking from time to time for new URLs in this cache and integrates them in the local database.</p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.6. How is my local Spot-on database taking part in the community distribution?</p>
<p align="left">Once you enable public connections for your Spot-on, connections to other community members are maintianed. Two Spot-on users then synchronise their database. That means, your Database is growing with a lot of URLs and this improves your search results.</p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.7. Can I delete an URL from my Database? How to specialize my Database? </p>
<p align="left">Yes, this is done by a blacklist. If you want to delete an URL from your loca Spot-on database, this URL will never be synchronized with other community members, because the Domain of the URL will be excluded, as well other URLs from this Domain then are not integrated. Of course you can use as well a whitelist, that means, e.g. to only allow URLs e.g. from the domain "http://en.wikipedia.org". This way some users contribute with specialized databases from e.g. several news portals, blogs or collections of their bookmarks etc. </p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.8. In which DLL is Spot-on present?</p>
<p align="left">If you install e.g. the windows version of Dooble Web Browser, then in the Install path of dooble you find the "libspoton.dll". This is the console programm, which is creating managing your local URL Database. The "spot-on.exe" file is the graphic user interface (GUI) to adress the settings of Spot-on (in the dll). "Shared.db" is the file, in which a feeder like e.g. Dooble Web Browser adds the URLs, you want to send to Spot-On. These three files manage your local URL database and the distribution of URLs to other users.</p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.9. Is it possible to access the Spot-on Database without beeing a member of the community? (offline local search) </p>
<p align="left">The search of the Spot-on database is possible at every time. It makes sense to be part of the community to update the URL database with every start of your machine. </p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.10. Is it secure to exchange URLs with other users?</p>
<p align="left">Yes, the connection to other users are a secured connection with encryption. The transfer is done over the http-protocol. It&acute;s just like browsing the web:  it is just like sending data in a website form or browsing the wikipedia. </p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.11. Can I set up several kernels on my webserver? </p>
<p align="left">Yes. Spot-On is composed of two separate applications, a kernel and a user interface. Both applications exist independently of one other. The kernel is responsible for all system-level functions. It maintains listener and neighbor activities, URL categorization, and URL searches. The interface communicates with the kernel via SQLite databases. Therefore, an advanced user may direct kernel activity from an SQLite prompt. Some communications also involve TCP sockets. If you intend to use several kernels, please create alternate directories and set SPOTON_HOME accordingly.</p>
<p align="left" class="Stil2">14.12. Do the communication inside Spot-On include digital signatures?</p>
<p align="left">No, there is no information or digital signature of the sender included. Just the  hash of your publik key. As it is a public key, it is not a digital signature.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
<p>==========================================================================</p>
<p class="Stil1">15. Technical Comparison to other Apps </p>
<p>Nevermind, every application has its own style, methods and techniques, technology and especially purposes, though some techical details may be different. We ar eopen for a comparion within the methods used by other applications, which has similar techniques implemented. This is just a start ramp for students to get familiar with the state of the art. Scientific Research on the comparisons  could be done in terms of e.g. a matrix out of some criteria and some applications. </p>
<p>Criteria could be:</p>
<p>(1) Active Development, (2) Active, huge Userbase, (3) Chat / Email Option, (4) Country Inclusion, (5) Decentral, (6) DHT, (7) Echo, (8) F2F, (9) Flashmarks, (10) HTTP-Protocol, (11) Kernel Separation from Gui, (12) keyed-Hashed Encryption, (13) layer/onion less, (14) LobbyChat, (15) localhost db search, (16) No need for Proxies, (17) Out of the Box encryption, (18) P2P, (19) P2P/F2F hybridity, (20) Public Key, (21) Queryhit Exposition Denial, (22) Repleo Method, (23) Symmetric Keys, (24) Turtle Hopping, (25) URL DB support, (26) Website Storage.<br>
</p>
<p>Applications could be:</p>
<p>(A) Alliance, (B) Antsp2p, (C) Arado, (D) BitMessage, (E) Faroo, (F) Freenet, (G) I2P, (H) Mute, (I) Offload, (J) Offsystem, (K) Oneswarm, (L) OTR, (M) Peek-A-Booty, (N) RetroShare, (O) RShare, (P) Stealthnet, (Q) Tor, (R) Waste, (S) YaCy.<br>
</p>
<p>We created that matrix, but do not publish it here, as the comparison needs more words in detail. That is up to the researchers now, to compare Spot-On and research on it.</p>
