Completed Items

1.     Inform the kernel of the key.
2.     Add colors to the kernel widgets. On OS X and Windows platforms,
       the kernel path must represent a readable program. On other platforms,
       the path must represent an executable program.
3.     If the passphrase is not set, disable all other tabs. Also
       disable the kernel and listeners group boxes.
4.     Sticky needs a tooltip describing the feature.
5.     Add a check box to hide all disconnected neighbors.
6.     Improve the IP input masks. Removed the underscores so that the
       spacebar may be used. Attached returnPressed() signals to
       listener and neighbor IP widgets.
7.     When the RSA key generation is finished, a confirmation should
       be displayed.
8.     The context menu to share the public key should be a button.
9.     Add an icon to a connected neighbor.
10.    libspoton.dll needs to be installed in the executable's path.

Remaining Items

1.     Re-encode various databases whenever the passphrase is changed.
2.     Add a database for the temporary chat keys of connected neighbors.
3.     Secure connections between the interface and the kernel.

Ideas

       Settings tab needs a side splitter for more settings such as: deny-get,
       deny-put. These functions do not exist.

       Fetching of new neighbors needs to be automated. Fetching is undefined.

       Auto-fetching needs a checkbox. Fetching is undefined.

       Add one listener before the kernel can be activated?. No,
       a kernel's importance is not defined by listeners.

       When listeners are only used as servers, add the name of the IRC
       channel. Listeners are always servers.

       Messages from channel nodes need to mirror all incoming messages to all
       connected neighbors with an UUID for that channel.

       Neighbors need names.

       Be sure that the sticky of a neighbor is not the IP but the key. DHT?

       Search requires three radio buttons for file, hash, and URL.

       Provide a means of filtering messages for the channel concept.

       The Participants table needs to contain friends and connected neighbors.

       Provide a means of filtering messages in chat.

       Add a mechanism for saving the chat key to a file.

       Provide a means of sending a message to friends only.

       Spot-On as a plugin.

       Display additional information pertaining to network information in
       the Neighbors table.

       Do not hide the OID column? The OID is always available. It is
       an internal database field.

       Add UUIDs to neighbors for DHT purposes.

       TTLs for channels.

       Add presence information to the Participants table.

       The kernel's GUI server port is non-standard. It's fine.

       Adding new neighbors create new local ports. As defined.

       May need GET and PUT messages.
