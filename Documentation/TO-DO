Completed Items

1.     Inform the kernel of the key.
2.     Add colors to the kernel widgets. On Windows platforms,
       the kernel path must represent a readable program. On other platforms,
       the path must represent an executable program.
3.     If the passphrase is not set, disable all other tabs. Also
       disable the kernel and listeners group boxes.
4.     Sticky needs a tooltip describing the feature.
5.     Add a check box to hide all disconnected neighbors. This was
       completed, however, it was removed on 06/03/2013. The option
       may cause confusion when a new neighbor is defined if a uniqueness
       error arises. Similar confusion may arise for listeners.
6.     Improve the IP input masks. Removed the underscores so that the
       spacebar may be used. Attached returnPressed() signals to
       listener and neighbor IP widgets.
7.     When the RSA key generation is finished, a confirmation should
       be displayed.
8.     The context menu to share the public key should be a button.
9.     Add an icon to a connected neighbor.
10.    libspoton.dll needs to be installed in the executable's path.
11.    Add presence information to the Participants table.
12.    Provide a means of sending a message to friends only.
13.    Add UUIDs to neighbors. 
14.    Display additional information pertaining to network information in
       the Neighbors table.
15.    Re-encode various databases whenever the passphrase is changed.
16.    Offline e-mail.
17.    Qt 4.6.3 support. Please ignore. Qt 4.6.x and older are not
       supported.
18.    Use QSslSockets.
19.    Inspect toInt() results.
20.    Encrypt the uuid field in the neighbors.db database.
21.    Encrypt-then-MAC.
       (http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/oem.html)
22.    Some messages are echoed. The transfer method (get, post) of the
       original message should be respected.
23.    Inspect spoton_crypt's hash failures.
24.    Secure connections between the interfaces and the kernel.
25.    Dedicated lines. Such lines, if enabled by both parties, do
       not allow echoed data.
26.    The re-encoding phase may produce errors. Delete corrupt entries.
27.    All database names should be unique.
28.    Depict listeners that support SSL.
29.    Echo mode for listeners.
30.    Reset keep-alive timers if valid data has been processed.
31.    The kernel should behave as a pass-through device if
       participants are not defined. However, it should emit
       scrambled messages if necessary.
32.    Improve kernel congestion cache.

Remaining Items

1.     Inspect UTF-8 uses.
2.     Introduce DSA and ElGamal?
3.     Echo proxy?
4.     Prioritize keep-alive messages.
5.     Use super-secure memory?
6.     Allow for other ciphers besides AES for e-mail.
7.     Local and long distance calling feature to limit PKI.
8.     E-mail retrieval may fail if a node is disconnected because of
       a lifetime expiration. Other communications may fail too.
9.     Country flags and names for hostnames.
10.    Monitor kernel health from the UI.
       See spoton::slotGeneralTimerTimeout().
11.    Favorite channels.
12.    Complete max. Neighbors fields.
13.    CGI for listeners.
14.    Auto-clear textedit widgets that contain too much data.
15.    Hard kernel termination. Control session separation.
16.    Colorful HTTP headers.
17.    Custom protocol messages for rapid redeployment.
18.    Customize expiration timers.
19.    Include external IP addresses in listener certificates.
20.    Provide a total silent mode.
21.    Provide complex IP blocking capabilities.
22.    Include licenses of other software where applicable.
       Satisfy the license soldiers.
23.    Entering geminis is difficult.
24.    Allow bonds across connections.
25.    Allow pass-through flow of non-Spot-On data.
