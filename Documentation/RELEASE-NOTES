0.02

1.   Listen for SSL mode changes on kernel sockets.
2.   Abort plaintext kernel sockets.
3.   Replaced messaging caches with hashes. Messages older than two
     minutes shall be purged.
4.   Corrected Qt 4.6.2 support. The 0.01 branch has been corrected
     as well. Please use Qt 4.8.5 and newer.
5.   Corrected memcpy() argument casts.
6.   Ability to set the Maximum Buffer Size and Maximum Content
     Length. Please see the Neighbors table.
7.   Deactivating a listener will not destroy its children. A new
     control option is available under the Listeners table's context menu.
8.   Prevent control updates of listeners and neighbors that have been
     marked for deletion.
9.   Corrected comments.
10.  Issues gcry_fast_random_poll() before gcry_create_nonce().
11.  SSL certificates and keys will now be created as new connections are
     established. Please remove the listeners.db and neighbors.db databases.
12.  Attempt to correct the connections count in the Listeners table.
13.  Removed spoton_crypt::generateSslKeys(arg1, arg2).
14.  Certificates expire within seven days.
15.  Corrected position of the Listeners table's context menu.
16.  Allow changing of echo modes for listeners. Children remain as
     configured. Eliminated bulky methods.
17.  Removed TTLs. Values can be used to explore Spot-On graphs.
18.  Congestion control is now enabled by default.
19.  Removed the certificates table from idiotes.db.
20.  Changed message protocols. Functionality with 0.01 is absent.
21.  Added message codes to Buzz messages.
22.  Modified most of spot-on-crypt.cc so that functions that return
     values return empty values on failures.
23.  Removed senseless resizing in spoton_crypt::decrypted().
25.  The digital signature that's created during e-mail retrieval has
     been modified so that the signature is generated from a random
     message.
26.  Inspect the signature public key's signature during repleo processing.
27.  Corrected log entries.
28.  Added Buzz channel types.
29.  The Hash Type combination box was incorrectly populated if libgcrypt
     failed to be initialized properly.
30.  Migrating message types from plaintext to ciphertext, where applicable.
     Task is slow. Please note that although the types are hidden, it
     is possible to guess message types based on the number of tokens.
     Problem will be addressed. Please also note that one may be able
     to distinguish ciphertexts produced from asymmetric ciphers and
     symmetric ciphers.
31.  Generate scrambled messages for an assortment of message types.
