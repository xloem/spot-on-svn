0.02 (08/00/2013)

1.   Listen for SSL mode changes on kernel sockets.
2.   Abort plaintext kernel sockets.
3.   Replaced messaging caches with hashes. Messages older than two
     minutes shall be purged.
4.   Corrected Qt 4.6.2 support. The 0.01 branch has been corrected
     as well. Please use Qt 4.8.5 and newer.
5.   Corrected memcpy() argument casts.
6.   Ability to set the Maximum Buffer Size and Maximum Content
     Length. Please see the Neighbors table.
7.   Deactivating a listener will not destroy its children. A new
     control option is available under the Listeners table's context menu.
8.   Prevent control updates of listeners and neighbors that have been
     marked for deletion.
9.   Corrected comments.
10.  Issue gcry_fast_random_poll() before gcry_create_nonce().
11.  SSL certificates and keys will now be created as new connections are
     established. Please remove the listeners.db and neighbors.db databases.
12.  Attempt to correct the connections count in the Listeners table.
13.  Removed spoton_crypt::generateSslKeys(arg1, arg2).
14.  Certificates expire within seven days.
15.  Corrected position of the Listeners table's context menu.
16.  Allow changing of echo modes for listeners. Children remain as
     configured. Eliminated bulky methods.
17.  Removed TTLs. Values can be used to explore Spot-On graphs.
18.  Congestion control is now enabled by default.
19.  Removed the certificates table from idiotes.db.
20.  Changed message protocols. Functionality with 0.01 is absent.
21.  Added message codes to Buzz messages.
22.  Modified most of spot-on-crypt.cc so that functions that return
     values return empty values on failures.
23.  Removed senseless resizing in spoton_crypt::decrypted().
24.  Added gui/gcryctl_init_secmem and kernel/gcryctl_init_secmem to
     the INI file.
25.  The digital signature that's created during e-mail retrieval has
     been modified so that the signature is generated from a random
     message.
26.  Inspect the signature public key's signature during repleo processing.
27.  Corrected log entries.
28.  Added Buzz channel types.
29.  The Hash Type combination box was incorrectly populated if libgcrypt
     failed to be initialized properly.
30.  Migrating message types from plaintext to ciphertext, where applicable.
     Task is slow. Please note that although the types are hidden, it
     is possible to guess message types based on the number of groups.
     Problem may be addressed. Please also note that one may be able
     to distinguish ciphertexts produced from asymmetric ciphers and
     symmetric ciphers.
31.  Generate scrambled messages for an assortment of message types.
32.  Allow neighbors to be detached from listener parents. Please
     see the Listeners table's context menu.
33.  The interface had a habit of periodically sending repetitive information
     to the kernel. Corrected.
34.  Modified Buzz channel keys. Instead of using the channel name as the key,
     gcry_kdf_derive() is used to generate a key. Unfortunately, the
     salt cannot be random and is based on the channel name and channel
     type. An optional salt may be provided. If possible, please improve
     the mechanism without introducing a distribution puzzle.
35.  Added support for Linux on the PowerPC architecture.
36.  The message_code field in email.db has been deprecated.
37.  Decipher Buzz messages in the kernel.
38.  Do not attempt to decipher messages in the kernel that require
     an interface instance.
39.  Long distance calling. Please see the Participant table's context
     menu.
40.  Use strong random bytes for status message keys.
41.  Use QVariant(QVariant::ByteArray), or equivalent, when attempting
     to store null database entries.
42.  Replaced QApplication::processEvents() with repaint(). processEvents()
     may cause problems on older versions of Qt.
43.  Optional signatures added to various communication protocols.
44.  Do not prompt for kernel activation if the kernel path does not represent
     an executable.
45.  Corrected UTF-8 issues in Buzz channels.
46.  Buzz channels will now accept UTF-8.
47.  The haveged package may increase the entropy on FreeBSD and Linux
     systems. Highly recommended.
48.  Replaced socket readyRead() signals in the kernel with 1.5-seconds
     timers. The change should alleviate burdened kernels. However,
     excessive data accumulation may occur.
49.  Qt 5.1 QHostAddress(QString) interprets IPv4 octets as octal values
     if the values are represented as such. For example, 192.168.178.015
     is interpreted as 192.168.178.13. Spot-On shall interpret IPv4 user
     input as is.
50.  Corrected notifications of Buzz activity.
51.  Replaced QSsl::TlsV1_2 with QSsl::SecureProtocols for Qt 5.x.
52.  Removed /echo/ instances from various hypertexts.
53.  spoton_listener::prepareNetworkInterface() must be called after
     an attempt of listen() is made. Otherwise, QTcpServer::serverAddress()
     will return an invalid address and cause the listener to exit
     prematurely.
54.  Gemini creation shall now be applied per participant instead
     of groups of participants.

0.01 (07/27/2013)

1.   Version 0.01 of Spot-On is now available.
